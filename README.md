Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Good morning sir, 
My webpage title Himmscomp was designed using HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS, Sass and @media.  Himmscomp is my dream IT service and training organization. It has four pages which are:
1. Home
2. Academy
3. Service
4. Contact

Home: the home also known as the homepage is the index.html document, here the title of the page link to the downloaded bootstrap 4 and link to the css file is housed in the head of the HTML document. this link was also used for the remaining html pages.
The body houses the header, nav, section, aside and footer.The index.html file this divisions were created to give the basic form of a webpage.
In the index file the the main section is formatted to the left wile the aside to the left and the showcase containing a picture with a text centralised to the center. boostrap is used to create the buttons in the index.html and any other button in the webpage.

Academy: The program.html pages houses the academy. Here three pictures were anchored through the html tag and a showcase was anchored through the css file. The body of the page was divided into two section a main section which houses the content and the three anchored pictures vertically and a sidebar that was pushed to the right that contain list of programs.

Services: In the services three horizontal columns were created using  bootstrap 4. The column each contain a picture and text. The side contains the services rendered by the organization.

Contact: The contact page contains a three column table and a form which was design using bootstrap. In the table the names of contact person, their phone numbers and emails were supplied. In the form Name, email and message input were created, a submit button was also created using bootstrap.

Sass: style.scss file was used for creating variables for color and other component, for examble the header and footer background color can be changed once. Nesting was achieved in the body of the html document for headers and fonts that was deployed to the remaining pages. Inheritance of related components for showcase and main components were achieved.

CSS: style.css was created by converting style.scss to style.css using visual code. and some corrections were deployed directly in the style.css file
@media was used and bootstrap to make the webpage to fit small devices.

Thank you.
